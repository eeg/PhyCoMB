\section{Workflows}

Here are some examples of how different kinds of Users might interact with \phycomb.

%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Explore \Performance of various \Methods for a particular \Task}
\label{sec:workflows_task}
%--------------------------------------------------

What \Methods are good or bad for my \Task of interest?

Select the desired \Task.
We will focus on ``state-dependent diversification'' with ``discrete traits,'' but eventually there might be others.
Still thinking about if we can have different possible Questions within a \Task, \eg ``Is this trait associated with diversification differences?'' versus ``Are speciation and extinction rates estimated accurately?''

Select the desired \Methods.
Choose by model/technique (\eg bisse, sister clades) and/or statistics (\eg AIC, Bayes factors).
Need a nice interface for this, but not too complicated.

Select the desired \Elements.
A few options here:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Those in the \Benchmark.
    \item Those in particular \Refsets.  Select from the list of \Refsets.
    \item Select based on attributes of \Elements, including attributes of \Trees and \Traits.  Will require a nice interface.
    \item All.  Warn how many this is.
\end{itemize}

Browse the \Performance report.
See \cref{sec:views_performance_task} for what this might look like and the types of interactivity needed.

Download the \Performance report.
See \cref{sec:downloads_report}.

%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Explore \Performance of a particular \Method for various \Tasks}
\label{sec:workflows_method}
%--------------------------------------------------

What \Tasks is this \Method good or bad for?

Select the desired \Method.
Default to all \Tasks, or select the desired ones.

Select the desired \Elements (see \cref{sec:workflows_task}).

Browse the \Performance report.
In this case, there will be a row for each \Task (instead of for each \Method; \cref{sec:views_performance_method}).
Need to think about if all tasks/questions can be answered with one number or symbol.

Download the \Performance report.

%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Contribute a new \Method}
%--------------------------------------------------

Explain why it is worthwhile---what was the purpose of creating it?
Specify what \Task it is for.
Provide basic info: what class of model/technique, what kind of statistical inference, \etc (see \cref{sec:tables_model}).
Provide a script that completely runs the \Method when provided with an \Element.
Script output should include simple summary numbers that can be provided as \Performance.
Perhaps multiple \Performance results if multiple \Tasks are addressed.
Require \Performance results for at least the \Benchmark of \Elements (see \cref{sec:workflows_performance}).

%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Contribute a new Element}
%--------------------------------------------------

Explain why it is worthwhile---what was the purpose of creating it?
Document so that it is completely reproducible: generating script, data source.
Include the data itself, or minimal pieces needed to generate or extract it?
Specify what it is intended for: \Task, \Refset.
Provide basic info: replicates, \Tree info, \Trait info.
Require Performance results (see \cref{sec:workflows_performance}).

%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Contribute new \Performance results}
\label{sec:workflow_performance}
%--------------------------------------------------

Find combinations of \Method + \Element that haven't yet be run.
Provide \Performance results.
Results could take different shapes for different \Tasks?


%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Deprecate a Method or Element}
%--------------------------------------------------

Don't entirely delete, but hide from most operations.
If it is superceded, could build this in to contributing the replacement.
