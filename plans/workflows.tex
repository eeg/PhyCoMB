\section{Workflows}
\label{sec:workflows}

Here are some examples of how different kinds of users might commonly interact with \phycomb.

%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Viewer workflows}
\label{sec:workflows_viewer}
%--------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Explore performance of various methods for a particular task}
\label{sec:workflows_task}

The user's goal is to learn about how various methods perform for questions they're interested in.
This means seeing which \Methods are available for a given \Task, and their \Performance, summarized in a \Report.
This is the most important user interface component to design well.
% (Rough ideas of Views in \cref{sec:views_task}.)

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Select the desired \Task.
          % See \cref{fig:views_select_task} for what that might look like.
    \item Select the desired \Methods.
          % See \cref{fig:views_select_method} for what that might look like.
    \item Select the desired \Elements.
          % See \cref{fig:views_select_element} for what that might look like.
    \item Browse the \Report.
          See \cref{sec:views_report_task} for the types of interactivity needed.
    \item Download the \Report.
          See \cref{sec:downloads_report}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Explore performance of a particular method for various tasks}
\label{sec:workflows_method}

The user's goal is to learn about how a method they're interested in performs for various questions.
This means seeing which \Tasks are addressed by a given \Method, and its \Performance, summarized in a \Report.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Select the desired \Method.
          % See \cref{fig:views_select_method} for what that might look like. % maybe panels (a) and (b)?
    \item Select the desired \Task, or default to all relevant \Tasks.
          % See \cref{fig:views_select_task} for what that might look like. % maybe panels (a) and (b)?
    \item Select the desired \Elements.
          % See \cref{fig:views_select_element} for what that might look like.
    \item Browse the \Report.
          See \cref{sec:views_report_method} for the types of interactivity needed.
    \item Download the \Report.
          See \cref{sec:downloads_report}.
\end{enumerate}

%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Contributor workflows}
\label{sec:workflows_contrib}
%--------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Contribute a new method}

The user's goal is to add a \Method to the ones available, thinking that it will be useful for other people.
% See \cref{fig:views_contrib_method} for what some of these steps might look like.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Browse existing \Methods to determine if it's already available.
    \item Provide a script that completely runs the \Method when provided with an \Element, returning the \Result of a \Task.
    \item Fill in a form with basic information (described in \cref{sec:tables_method}).
          This info helps to categorize the \Method in the database, and it will be passed along to future users who see the \Method.
    \item Upload \Results for at least the \Benchmark of \Elements.
    \item See a \Report to confirm that things look correct.
    \item Request that an Administrator accept the new \Method?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Contribute a new element}

The user's goal is to add an \Element to the ones available, thinking that it will be useful for other people.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Browse existing \Elements to determine if it or something similar is already available.
    \item Provide data files for the new \Element (see \cref{sec:tables_element}).
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Generating script, if applicable.  Link to empirical data source. \etc
                  Needs to be completely documented and reproducible.
            \item The actual tree and trait files.
                  Or if using \Tree and/or \Trait from another \Element, link to that.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Fill in a form with basic information (described in \cref{sec:tables_element}).
          This info helps to categorize the \Element in the database, and it will be passed along to future users who see the \Element.
    \item Upload \Results for all(?) \Methods that apply to that \Refset.
    \item See a \Report to confirm that things look correct.
    \item Request that an Administrator accept the new \Element.
          (If the new \Element is better than an existing one, include a deprecation request?)
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Contribute a new performance result}
\label{sec:workflow_performance}

This could be part of the workflow in contributing a new \Method or \Element.
But it could also be done separately.
In that case, find combinations of \Method + \Element that haven't yet be run, and fill in the values.

%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Administrator workflows}
\label{sec:workflows_admin}
%--------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Alter the groupings of elements}

Alter the \Elements in a \Refset.
Alter the \Elements and/or \Refsets in a \Benchmark.

\subsubsection{Approve an addition from a Contributor}

Check the new \Method or \Element and publish it (make it available to all users) if it looks good.
Maybe a general form for other requests, \eg to deprecate an \Element?

\subsubsection{Deprecate a method or element}

Don't entirely delete from the database, but hide from most operations?

\subsubsection{Manage users}

Field requests from users who wish to become Contributors?
Or just let that be automatic, and then revoke Contributor status if someone causes trouble?
