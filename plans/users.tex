\section{Users}

Different kinds of Users will interact with \phycomb in different ways.
They will have different goals and permissions.
One person could be a different User at different times, e.g., I could do some work as an Administrator, then add data as a Contributor, than look through results as a Viewer.

\subsection{Administrator}

read, add, delete
login required

\subsection{Contributor}

add, but only after Administrator approves the submission?
login required

\subsection{Viewer}

read-only
no login required
