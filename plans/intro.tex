\section{Introduction}

This document is intended to be a high-level description of the functionality and structure of what \phycomb will eventually look like.
Ultra-briefly:
The goal is to allow users to compare the performance of different phylogenetic methods.
There will be a web interface that allows for browsing those performance results, and for contributing new results.
Behind that will be a database of the testing datasets, methods, and results.
